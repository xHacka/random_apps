Simple html

## b64app

Simple base64 encoder and decoder, with a dash of SQL.

## Uploader

Somewhat simple prettified PHP upload server, maybe not the most secure too.

Can be used to list saved files (txt,pdf) and download them.
`/data` endpoint can receive pdf that has been compressed with gzip and encoded with base64, then save it as pdf and as text.
